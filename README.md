Structure for performing Image Classification :
Image Pre processing : It is to improve image data (features) by removing noise and desired distortions and enhancing key aspects so that model can operate with this better data. Reading the image, Resizing the image, and Data Augmentation are all steps in the image pre-processing process
Detection of an Object : It is a computer vision technique that works to identify and locate objects within an image or video.
Feature extraction and training: This is an important step wherein statistical or deep learning methods is used to detect the patterns of the image, features that might be unique to a particular class this will help in differentiating the classes. This process where the model learns the features from the dataset is called model training.
Classification of the object: This stage provides an appropriate classification approach to classify observed objects into predetermined classes by comparing image patterns to target patterns.

Classes used : 'paper', 'plastic', 'trash', 'metal', 'cardboard', 'glass'.
Accuracy Obatined : 90%

Steps to run the code :
1) Import all the required libraries.
2) Import the datasets 
3) divide the datasets into train , test and validation 
4) Built Image augmentation
5) Designed the neural network
6) trained the model
7) test the model
8) Implement the model.
